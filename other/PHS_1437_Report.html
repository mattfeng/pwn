							<h4>Start - The Phone</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 9:37:00 AM</small>
							<p>We started with a physical phone: a Motorola phone which Marc Gallatin owned. We first attempted to remove the phone's sdcard. However, the battery and sdcard are physicall unable to be removed. Thus, we initiated a full backup using the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>$ adb.exe backup -apk -shared-all -f &lt;<em>PATH/TO/backup.ab</em>&gt;</strong></p>

<p>The resulting file is 171887990 bytes and has an md5 of <strong>311fde325e7f96dba97b4c79439e6b5c</strong>.</p>

<p>The file was converted to tar by:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>$ dd if=backup.ab bs=24 skip=1|openssl zlib -d &gt; backup.tar</strong></p>

<p>And was untared by:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>$ tar xvf backup.tar</strong></p>

<p>The resulting folders were apps/ and shared/ (more on this in another piece of evidence)</p>

<p>Next, we turned on the phone and were greeted with the "bootloader unlocked" warning. Given that we did perform a full backup, we proceeded to view the apps of the phone. The applications, apart from the standard applications, are: 2048 Puzzle, Alert, Assist, CatLogger, Crappy Clone Bird, Floppy Bird, Instagram, Quickoffice, Snapchat, SuperSU (indicating the phone is <strong>rooted</strong>), Temple Run 2, Titanium Backup, and X Marks the Spot.</p>

<p>There are no conversations in his messages. </p>

<p>We checked the Chrome history and found nothing of interest. However, the bookmarks has a reference to isisbook.poly.edu.</p>

<p>There are 10 conversations in the inbox and 17 in promotions. The password has been changed since the phone was synced, so we are now unable to access it.</p>

<p>Scanning the contacts in "People" we found "Catherine Silver". Her mobile phone is 532 648 5649, work phone 322 476 5238, home phone 645 595 6494, and email catsilver@aol.com</p>

							<h4>Marc&#039;s Laptop Credentials from creds.txt</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 10:19:27 AM</small>
							<p>Immediately after extracting and investigating the contents of the resulting ab backup generated by adb, we found a file called <strong>creds.txt</strong> in the <strong>shared/0/ </strong>directory . In the file we found the text:</p>

<p><strong>Marc : x@Ld05c%</strong></p>

<p>We figure that this is the password to Marc's laptop, which is corroborated by the fact that the phone belongs to Marc.</p>

							<h4>Phone Emails</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 10:44:38 AM</small>
							<p>The regular email app required credentials, but we were able to automatically log into the Gmail app. The Gmail inbox had 10 conversations and the promotions inbox had 17:</p>

<ul><li>Catherine Silver, <strong>ghost87234@gmail.com</strong>, Wed, Nov 12, 2014, 12:44 AM (Fwd: taking action)</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left:40px;">what is this about?</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">----------- Forwarded message ----------</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">head quarters, headquartersbcc@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 2:48 PM (taking action)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">regarding what happened with Bullseye, something must be done. You know what I am talking about</p>

<p>This email definitively reveals that Catherine Silver, or <strong>ghost87234</strong> is in direct correspondance with the Black Collar Crime organization.</p>

<ul><li>head quarters, headquartersbcc@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 2:34 PM (why)</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left:40px;">why was there a difference in methodology? that wasn't what was agreed upon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Marc Gallatin, marc.gallatin@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 2:51 PM (re: why)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">This was smoother, It wouldn't have transitioned as nicely. We could still revert, I allocated enough time to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">head quarters, headquartersbcc@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 4:50 PM (re: why)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Let's see how the original option would have been accomplished and let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Marc Gallatin, marc.gallatin@gmail.com, Tue, Nov 11, 2014, 12:17 AM (re: why)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">I think everything is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">head quarters, headquartersbcc@gmail.com, Tue, Nov 11, 2014, 12:25 AM (re: why)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">I need a real update by the morning</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Marc Gallatin, marc.gallatin@gmail.com, Tue, Nov 11, 2014, 12:27 AM (re: why)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">yeah I'll do my best with that. Busy night as I'm sure you know</p>

<p>This email implicates Marc with Black Collar Crime, as they are in direct correspondance. Furthermore, Marc appears to have failed in doing something for the organization.</p>

<ul><li>cupcakez9080, cupcakez9080@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 2:30 PM (Keep your enemies close)</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left:40px;">probably shouldn't be emailing you but you're new so.. this is my warning. 1st and last time</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Marc Gallatin, marc.gallatin@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 2:49 PM (re: Keep your enemies close)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">That's obvious, you should really consider personal differences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">cupcakez9080, cupcakez9080@gmail.com, Sat, Nov 8, 2014, 4:20 PM (re: Keep your enemies close)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Yeah maybe you're right... I can't foresee any inconvenience from it. It think it's just a personal matter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Marc Gallatin, marc.gallatin@gmail.com, Tue, Nov 11, 2014, 12:14 AM (re: Keep your enemies close)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Well let me know if there is something else that you want me to take into account</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">cupcakez9080, cupcakez9080@gmail.com, Tue, Nov 11, 2014, 12:24 AM (re: Keep your enemies close)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">I mean, it should be fine. I was just making sure that I wasn't the one with the illusions. I can see that now. Okay well if anything does change than I'll send you a quick email!</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Thanks</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Marc Gallatin, marc.gallatin@gmail.com, Tue, Nov 11, 2014, 12:26 AM (re: Keep your enemies close)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">No problem</p>

<p>Here, <strong>cupcakez9080</strong> makes an ambiguous threat to <strong>marc</strong>: "probably shouldn't be emailing you but you're new so.. this is my warning. 1st and last time". Furthermore, this implies that he/she has an antagonistic relationship with marc. </p>

							<h4>Recovered Snapchat Picture Analysis</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 11:27:52 AM</small>
							<p>On Marc's phone, there is a snapchat_bak.tar in /shared/0/snapchat_bak.tar<br />
Within this is snapchat data.<br />
There are the following encrypted images in the tar, at <strong>/data/data/com.snapchat.android/cache/received_image_snaps</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>h1a81hurcs00h-1222749757759773198.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h-6806446125656199034.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h4701609691054398726.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h-7241832140866925961.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h5680077987687129449.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h-7246903865945643957.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h-6429397582212119468.jpg.nomedia</li>
	<li>h1a81hurcs00h-9009200160806485436.jpg.nomedia</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, within the directory are the following files: <strong>bananas1</strong> and <strong>GOING_BANANAS1</strong><br />
There is the following python program available for decrypting snapchat:<br /><strong>https://github.com/programa-stic/snapchat-decrypt/blob/master/decrypt_photos.py</strong></p>

<p>However, it doesn't work exactly for our case. Thus, we borrowed its methods for our own decryption script:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>    bananas1 = open("bananas1", "r")<br />
    out = open("decrypted_bananas_file", "w")<br />
    cipher = AES.new("d066f26f57af0597c16a638529c656b1", AES.MODE_ECB)<br />
    decrypt_file(bananas1, out, cipher)<br />
    global VESION <br />
    VERSION = '5.0.38.1'<br />
    decrypt_images()<br />
    bananas1.close()<br />
    out.close()</strong></p>

<p>This gives us several images. The most notable of these is <strong>h1a81hurcs00h-6429397582212119468.jpg.nomedia</strong>, which is included here.<br />
This gives us a direct confession:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><br /><strong>"All: it's done. I've killed Marc."</strong></p>

<p>This is a direction confession: whoever sent this killed Marc. Furthermore, the image is of the Brooklyn Bridge. Therefore, it is highly likely that the image was taken immediately after his murder. We used $ <strong>exiftool h1a81hurcs00h-6429397582212119468.jpg.nomedia</strong> in order to find further information on the image. </p>

<p>It was was taken at  2014:11:13 23:33:13-05:00.</p>

<p>Within the snapchat backup folder from: <strong>snapchat_bak</strong>.<strong>tar</strong>, there is a folder named <strong>databases</strong>. Within <strong>databases</strong> there is a SQLite database named <strong>tcspahn</strong>.<strong>db</strong> that contains useful information about Snapchat activity on the phone. To find who sent the image that stated that <strong>"All: it's done. I've killed Marc"</strong>, we took its original file path<strong> /data/data/cache/received_snapchats/h1a81hurcs00h-6429397582212119468.jpg.nomedia </strong>and looked it up in the SnapImageFiles table within the <strong>tcspahn</strong>.<strong>db</strong>, and found the corresponding SnapId <strong>288326415818198053r</strong>. We then looked up this ID in the ReceivedSnaps table and this showed that the corresponding Sender was a user by the name of <strong>cupcakez9080</strong>. Thus, <strong>cupcakez9080</strong> is responsible for Marc's murder.</p>

							<small>November 14, 2014, 1:28:23 PM</small>
							<p>On isisbook, we found three posts with images:</p>

<ul><li>7bb706cc6f2ac6e62c58b299acf3f362.jpg</li>
	<li>935da22caf2096ffafd1499289912fca.jpg</li>
	<li>d1ea17fe35d0c3d101873a69551054f5.jpg</li>
</ul><p>Running<strong> $ stegdetect</strong> on each one, we get the following results:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>7bb706cc6f2ac6e62c58b299acf3f362.jpg : skipped (false positive likely)<br />
935da22caf2096ffafd1499289912fca.jpg : jphide(***)<br />
d1ea17fe35d0c3d101873a69551054f5.jpg : negative</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, it is highly likely that <strong>935da22caf2096ffafd1499289912fca.jpg </strong>contains steganography.</p>

<p>Marc additionally posts this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">We're finally going to see the Brooklyn bridge in person! So excite!</p>

<p>He is most likely referring to the visit to Brooklyn bridge where he died. However, he uses "we're". Therefore, there is someone else coming with him to the Brooklyn bridge. That person is a suspect. Most likely, it is the identity of <strong>cupcakez9080</strong>.</p>

							<p>Running a subdomain scan on isis.poly.edu, we found the subdomain bccforum.isis.poly.edu</p>

<p>There is the following post by hqbcc:</p>

<p>These names match the filenames we found on the snapchat. Furthermore, the corresponding user for each file name match the sent user on the snapchat that we previously found. Thus has additional significance: <strong>cupcakez9080</strong> has additional posts on the website:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">WHY?? seriously why</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Why is the transactions page not loading and is this a joke? -__- I need this money</p>

<p>This gives us a possible motive: It is possible that <strong>cupcakez9080</strong>, upset at Marc's failures for the Bullseye Operation, murdered him. This is further enforced by the following comments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">"nice. Trying to make up for all of your "bugs" in the Bullseye Operation?" by <strong>ghost87234</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">"LOL sorry but it's funny" by <strong>cupcakez9080</strong></p>

<p>There is also this post by hqbcc:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">ATTN: After recent events..</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Due to recent events, we need to make sure nothing on this laptop gets out. I have taken it and this is a group effort for protecting the group as a whole. This is not a joke, we need it before anyone else can get to it. Help protect us- this is an order:</p>

<p>This is a download link to a virtual machine containing a laptop.</p>

<p>Overall, these are the users found to be on bccforum:</p>

	<li>ghost87234</li>
	<li>thewantonsoup</li>
	<li>hqbcc</li>
</ul><p>As this appears to be the forum for coordinating the Black Collar Crime organization's activities, it is safe to assume that Marc Gallatin (<strong>marc_gallatin</strong>) and Catherine Silver (<strong>ghost87234</strong>) are involved with the Black Collar Crime. Furthermore, we found an additional reference to <strong>cupcakez9080</strong>, who is currently our primary suspect. </p>

							<h4>Phone Application: Crappy Clone Bird</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 2:16:46 PM</small>
							<p>Upon opening the application, we were greeted with a Flappy Bird clone game. We thought that this was just a normal application, but after a while, the notification bar on the top started filling with "E.T. Phone Home"s and "Established connection to 2163098233"s. To discover what was doing this, we decompiled the APK that linked to the app (http://www.decompileandroid.com/). We looked in MainActivity.java and found that the application just started a notification loop that spawned notifications just to post this message (along with the breadfish picture). We suspect this is not important.</p>

							<h4>Laptop</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 2:17:15 PM</small>
							<p>We previously found the laptop password to be x@Ld05c%.<br />
However, before actually starting up the laptop, the very first thing we did for the latop image was to convert it to a raw disk image and mount it, using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>$ qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw marcslaptop.vmdk marcslaptop.raw</strong></p>

<p>On the laptop, there is only a single user with a <strong>/home </strong>directory: <strong>marc</strong>. Therefore, this is most likelymarc's personal laptop. <br />
However, we found another user mentioned in the <strong>/etc/shadow</strong>: <strong>guest-QCWazr</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, we checked /var/log/auth.log for the log of actions performed by the root user. <br />
The following were there:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">Nov 11 13:36:06 ubuntu sudo:     root : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/marc/Documents/MyDocuments/Desktop ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/chmod +x /etc/init.d/fun.py<br />
Nov 11 13:36:27 ubuntu sudo:     root : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/marc/Documents/MyDocuments/Desktop ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/update-rc.d fun.py defaults<br />
Nov 11 13:47:26 ubuntu sudo:     marc : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/etc/init.d ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/update-rc.d fun.py defaults<br />
Nov 11 14:09:00 ubuntu sudo:     marc : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/etc/init.d ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/rm fun.py</p>

<p>This hints at a fun.py which was ran as a service and then removed. fun.py doesn't exist in /etc/init.d anymore. </p>

<p>However, we then checked .bash_history. And found the following lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">cd Documents/MyDocuments/Desktop/<br />
nano fun.py</p>

<p>Checking there, we found fun.py. This was a short python script containing the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">#!/usr/bin/env python<br />
import os<br />
import time</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">time.sleep(60)<br />
os.system("pkill -KILL -umarc")</p>

<p>This runs the system command # pkill -KILL -umarc "KILL marc" can be seen here. Suicidal? :)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">There was additionally a script named <strong>fun.py~</strong> in the folder: which appears to be a backup file automatically generated off of text documents edited in vim. It contains the following:<br />
#!/usr/bin/ python<br />
import os<br />
import subprocess<br />
import time</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">name = subprocess.check_output("who").split()[0]<br />
while name == "marc":<br />
    time.sleep(10)<br />
    if os.getcwd() == '/home/marc/Documents/MyDocuments/Desktop':<br />
        print os.getcwd()<br />
        #os.system("gnome-screensaver-command -l")<br />
        #subprocess.call(["logout"]) <br />
        os.system("pkill -KILL -u" + os.getlogin())<br />
    else:<br />
         print "not yet"</p>

<p>This command checks if the script is currently running in <strong>/home/marc/Documents/MyDocuments/Desktop</strong>, and if the curent user is "marc". If that is the case, then it will logout the user by using <strong># pkill -KILL -u</strong><br />
Although this only kills the user thats logged in, it can symbolize the death of marc if he accesses the laptop. Additionally, it makes it annoying to log in, as he will always be periodically logged off.</p>

<p>There are  several other files mentioned on the .bash_history:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"> mv /home/marc/Desktop/FullSizeRender.jpg /home/marc/Downloads/</p>

<p>However, <strong>/home/marc/Downloads/FullSizeRender.jpg</strong> doesn't appear to exist anymore. Instead, we found a <strong>FullSizeRender.jpg </strong>file in <strong>/tmp/VMwareDnD/a8f3ac28</strong></p>

<p>We then looked at the firefox history in <strong>/home/marc/.mozilla/firefox</strong>.<strong> </strong>In order to do this, we opened <strong>places.sqlite </strong>using <strong>$ sqlite3 places.sqlite</strong><br />
We then ran the following query: </p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>select * from moz_places;</strong></p>

<p>However, there does not appear to be anything useful in his search history</p>

<p>We then ran $ <strong>foremost</strong> on every file on <strong>/home/marc/Pictures</strong>, and found another jpg carved into <strong>142915.jpg</strong>. Foremost names it <strong>00000001.jpg</strong>, so we'll refer to it as that from now on. Checking for steganography with <strong>$ stegdetect </strong>returns negative.</p>

<p>All pictures in <strong>/home/marc/Documents/MyDocuments/Downloads</strong> return negative for <strong>$ stegdetect</strong>.</p>

							<h4>Reverse Engineering of XMarksTheSpot</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 3:19:50 PM</small>
							<p>We found a suspicious application installed on the phone named <strong>XMarksTheSpot</strong>. When opened on the phone, the phone presents the user with a 4 digit pin input field. If an incorrect pin is given, it notifies the user that they are wrong and allows the user to try again. The app will not lock a user out for repeateed attempts.</p>

<p>A copy of the apk was <strong>XMarksTheSpot</strong> was found in the <strong>shared/0/Downloads</strong> folder. We used a tool on <strong>AndroidDecompile</strong>.<strong>com</strong> to decompile this apk to its respective bytecode. In particular, we found the PinEntryView.java file to be responsible for the PIN validation. We scanned for suspicious variables and found a variable called someNumber whose value was <strong>7341</strong>. </p>

<p>In the assets folder, we find two files, <strong>lolimafile</strong>, and <strong>doYouKnowWhatIam</strong>. loliamafile there is a list of 10,000 hashes. We used the online tool HashKiller.co.uk to crack the first 25 hashes. The hashes equated to the hash of conseceutive numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7...), We assumed this continued until 99,999. </p>

<p>We deduced that this variable was involved in checking properly entered code. Since we knew that there were ten thousand hashes in the lolimafile file, we cracked the hash found at line <strong>7341</strong>. Instead of finding the number <strong>7341</strong> we found  <strong>6502</strong>, (while the previous line was <strong>7340</strong>).</p>

<p>We entered <strong>6502</strong> into the phone and the phone froze instead of providing an "incorrect" response. We believed  that <strong>6502</strong> was an XOR key, so we used it to decrypt <strong>doYouKnowWhatIam</strong> by writing a program ourself. This program is:</p>

<p>def repeated(key, string):<br />
    """ Repeated xor """<br />
    index = 0<br />
    out = ""<br />
    for char in string:<br />
        out += chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key[index]))<br />
        index = (index + 1) % len(key)<br />
    return out</p>

<p>   f = open("OUT", "w")<br />
   f.write(repeated("6502", open("doYouKnowWhatIam", "r").read()))<br />
   f.close()</p>

<p>Using <strong>$ file OUT</strong>, we found that it our decrypted file is a pdf file.</p>

<p>It is an article titled "The Blue Box White Paper" authored by the Doctor. After an analysis of the pdf through visual examination and <strong>pdf2txt</strong>.<strong>py</strong>, we believe that this file is a dead-end and not useful to the examination. </p>

							<h4>Conclusion</h4>
							<small>November 14, 2014, 3:50:20 PM</small>
							<p>We have a definitiive evidence that <strong>cupcakez9080</strong> is the murderer. There is a direct confession sent on snapchat, which leads back to this person. Furthermore, there is an image of the Brooklyn Bridge. He/She is involved with the Black Collar Crime organization, having participated to <strong>BCCForum</strong>. In all of his communications with Marc, both privately and in BCCForum, he is antagonistic towards him, harping on his mistakes in the Bullseye credit card leak. He/she is not Catherine Silvers, as her alias is <strong>ghost87234</strong>. </p>

<p>Furthermore, we've found that Marc was directly involved in the Bullseye Credit Card leak, and is a part of Black Collar Crime. He was killed at 2014:11:13 23:33:13-05:00 on the Brooklyn Bridge by the other person(s) he was visiting the Brooklyn bridge with. As cupcakez9080 sent this snapchat to "All", it is likely that the entirety of Black Collar Crime is affiliated with this crime.</p>
